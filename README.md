# Project: Calculator

This is the fifth project of the Fundamentals course of The Odin Project.

The description of the project is [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).

The demo page is [here](https://ebaek88.github.io/calculator/).

In this project, I was able to practice various DOM manipulation methods, event listeners, object-oriented programming, and stack data structure.

The calculator I have implemented have several features. The basic calculations and the all-clear function were implemented using stack data structure. In addition, a feature was implemented that prevents a division by 0. Also, if consecutive operator buttons are pressed, the calculator does not run any evaluations; it only takes the last operator entered to be used for the next operation. Last but not least, a "backspace" button is implemented so the user can undo their last input if they click the wrong number.

The calculator is functional with keyboard input as well as mouse clicks.

Lastly, while working on the project, I have also tried to use the best practice for writing git commits, namely the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
